## Godfather
Considered one of the greatest films ever made, this mob drama, adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, centers on the influential Italian-American crime family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). Michael (Al Pacino), the youngest son, hesitantly steps into the Mafia world, only to find himself ensnared in a relentless loop of violence and treachery. Despite his efforts to keep a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), Michael finds himself increasingly absorbed by the family's criminal undertakings.
